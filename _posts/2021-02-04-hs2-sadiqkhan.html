title: Diggind their own Graves?
subtitle: HS2 Rebellion and the 'mad risk' of Non Violent Direct Action
---

<p>
Sadiq Khan has little sympathy with the tactics of the HS2 protesters,
who, having been pulled from the tops of the old trees in Euston
Square Gardens, now try to hold fort among their roots.
</p>

<p>
'This is no way to protest,' the Mayor of London condemned <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/london/2021-02-01/hs2-protest-bailiffs-very-close-to-breaking-through-euston-tunnels">on ITV News
on Monday</a>. 'By building these tunnels underneath the surface you are
taking risks with your safety and the safety of others.  I don't want
anybody to be hurt during these protests so I would ask them to
reconsider and to safely and peacefully leave these tunnels.'
</p>

<p>
The Mayor of London claims that protesting should not involve risking
one's safety. But it is precisely in this that Non Violent Direct
Action draws its power. The strategy's ancestor is Ghandi, and as he
wrote to the Viceroy of India on 2 March 1930:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I know that in embarking on non-violence I shall be
running what might fairly be termed a mad risk. But the victories of
truth have never been won without risks, often of the gravest
character.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The HS2 Rebellion protesters are indeed risking their lives as a means
of resisting a project which shall tear through many of England's last
remaining ancient forests. Ploughing through countryside communities
at an expense which could peel the flammable cladding off of
towerblocks up and down the country, could more than bandage up the
NHS, could cover the university tuition fees of a generation of
students who have lost a year of schooling to the pandemic, could do
so much good were it to be creatively deployed. But which is being
spent, maddeningly, all just to reduce by half-an-hour the time of
commute between the country's two wealthiest cities, London and
Birmingham.
</p>

<p>
It may seem a 'mad risk' to not just do politics from behind a desk
like the Mayor of London. Especially underground and under a
pandemic. But in Euston Square Gardens, the protesters on the ground
were swept away by guards in their numbers. The protesters locked on
to the tops of trees were snagged off like unripe fruit by security in
cranes, their coats and waterproofs confiscated in advance. The
protesters behind barricaded tents had their tents removed on
rain-drenched nights, only to be arrested by morning. And for months
the protests in general struggled to get significant media traction
using other (<a href="https://www.hs2rebellion.earth/2020/10/15/hs2-security-assault-a-69-year-old-man/">also</a> <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/london/2020-12-08/eco-warrior-swampy-arrested-as-hs2-protest-in-denham-ends">incredibly</a> <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2020/07/27/eco-activists-injured-20-foot-drop-trees-when-contractors-cut-ropes-13037213/">brave</a>) tactics. So the tactic of those
clinging to the roots, the last ones standing (or rather, crawling and
squatting), is by all objective counts the most effective in
town. Show me another.
</p>

<p>
Sadiq Khan frets for their safety, but so do many of these protesters'
supporters, myself included. The difference is that we hold that HS2's
tunnel eviction squad have scandalously mishandled the eviction
process &#x2013; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/29/hs2-protesters-conditions-euston-tunnel-deteriorating">cutting off their air supply, demolishing
flood-protections</a>, preventing their having an hour's rest, digging a
parallel tunnel and in numerous ways trying to rout them like so many
foxes &#x2013; and we call for the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/extinction-rebellion-activists-ordered-to-leave-hs2-tunnel-for-their-own-safety-hgzsnkq6q">mishandled</a> potentially-lethal eviction to
be halted.
</p>

<p>
Despite having never been violent, London's Mayor tells them to leave
'peacefully'. What kind of peace does he mean? A peace where climate
catastrophe happens without effective resistance? Where none put
Earth's life before their own?
</p>

<p>
Ghandi once said, 'For the English, peace is the peace of the grave.'
Paradoxically, it is the brave protesters underground, not our Mayor,
who show another side to the story.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
